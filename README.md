BINARY TREE


A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

In a binary tree:

The topmost node is called the root.
Each node can have zero, one, or two children.
Nodes without children are called leaf nodes or terminal nodes.
Binary trees are typically used to represent hierarchical structures, such as expressions, file systems, or hierarchical data.
